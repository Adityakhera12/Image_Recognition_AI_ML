What You Have to Do (Step-by-Step):
Preprocess and Explore Your Dataset
Download a free image dataset (e.g., MNIST, Cats vs. Dogs, CIFAR-10 from Kaggle); normalize, resize, and visualize sample images using Python and OpenCV.

Build & Train Your First CNN Model
Implement a basic convolutional neural network using TensorFlow/Keras in Google Colab, train it on your dataset, and monitor accuracy/loss metrics.

Enhance with Data Augmentation & Model Evaluation
Apply image augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping) and evaluate your model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Visualize your results using Matplotlib.

Optimize with Transfer Learning
Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2 or similar) on your dataset, compare its performance to your custom CNN, and analyze improvements.
